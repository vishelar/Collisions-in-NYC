# Collisions-in-NYC
Spatial Analytics Project on Analysis of collisions in New York City

New York City, like other major urban areas, have a high density of both vehicle and human traffic. The objective of this project is to identify areas of New York City that are at high risk for vehicle collisions based on a series of factors. We will define the time period in which collisions are happening as between January 1st, 2015 to January 1st, 2016. 

A metrics and consequent hotspots for risk are  identified and the proposed solutions are to be presented to the Department of Transportation to increase pedestrian and traffic safety.
